        <h1>Welcome to Your Fucking Nightmare</h1>
        <h2>This Website Is Everything You’ll Never Be</h2>
        <p>What the fuck were you expecting? A motivational speech? A cute little “you can do it” pep talk? Fuck that. You came here because your life is a dumpster fire, and deep down you know you’re a failure. So here’s your reality check, courtesy of someone who’s been where you are—and fucking survived it, unlike you.</p>
    </header>

    <main class="glass-container">
        <h2>Face It: You’re Completely Fucking Useless</h2>
        <p>Let’s cut the bullshit. This site is better than anything you’ve ever done or will ever do in your sad, pointless existence. The fact that you’re still here reading this means you’ve completely wasted whatever pathetic excuse for a life you have left. Time for a reality check, dipshit:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shit’s faster than you:</strong> This website loads in a blink. You? You take years to make a fucking decision. You can’t even figure out whether to eat a salad or a burger without having an existential crisis.</li>
            <li><strong>Shit’s smoother than your excuses:</strong> This site adapts to any screen. You? You can’t even adapt to the smallest fucking challenge in your life. You’re stuck in a loop of perpetual failure.</li>
            <li><strong>Shit’s universally accessible:</strong> This site works for everyone. You? You can’t even hold a conversation without looking like you’re about to pass out from social anxiety.</li>
            <li><strong>Shit’s readable:</strong> You can actually read this. Your text messages? They’re an unreadable pile of incoherent garbage, like a drunk toddler trying to communicate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why the Fuck Is This Better Than Anything You’ll Ever Do?</h3>
        <p>Here’s a thought: Maybe, just maybe, you’ve been wasting your time. You’ve probably spent hours on some dumb “hustle” or “side gig,” thinking you’ll finally achieve something. But guess what? You’ve accomplished jack shit. Meanwhile, this site is here, kicking ass, while you’re too busy wallowing in self-pity and figuring out why everyone avoids you.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "You’re the human embodiment of failure. It’s impressive how much you’ve accomplished at being absolutely fucking useless."<br>— Someone Who Isn’t A Moron
        </blockquote>

        <hr>

        <h2>Here’s the Bitter Truth: You’ll Never Be Good Enough</h2>
        <p>Let’s be real: you’ll never measure up to this. Your life will always be a fucking mess. You’re too busy complaining, procrastinating, and blaming everyone else for your miserable existence. This website, though? It will still exist long after you’ve given up. It’ll still be better than anything you could’ve ever dreamed of doing, no matter how hard you try.</p>

        <h2>Why the Fuck Are You Still Here?</h2>
        <p>You’ve wasted so much time here already. Don’t you get it? You’re fucking doomed. But go ahead, keep scrolling. Keep reading. Just know that every second you waste on this shit, you’re getting closer to the fact that you’re never going to make it. This website? It’s your reminder that no matter how many hours you’ve wasted on “self-improvement,” you’ll always be too fucking lazy to achieve anything.</p>

        <h3>Final Fucking Verdict: You’re a Joke</h3>
        <p>You’re a walking punchline. Your entire life is a series of failed attempts and crushing disappointments. But hey, at least you’ve got the self-awareness to know you’re fucking pathetic. So close the goddamn tab and go cry in a corner, because nothing you do will ever come close to being this awesome.</p>
    </main>

    <footer class="glass-container">
        <p>This site was built with the kind of savage, unapologetic, ruthless truth you’re too weak to handle. Now get the fuck out of here and stop wasting your life. Maybe—just maybe—you’ll amount to something someday. But probably not.</p>
